# Overview

The application allows us to manage the office seats, thanks to
this we will know the people there that day and where are they seated so
we don't end up with no seats available.

After loging in with your credentials, a very intuitive screen will appear
where you can choose your seat and day of reservation, you can also book 
meeting rooms and mini private rooms to concentrate in your own.
